# Example Binder with a Dockerfile

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/docross/normal_distributions)
A Binder-compatibible repository that contains its own `Dockerfile`.

Your `Dockerfile` just needs to extend from the [`base`](https://github.com/binder-project/binder-build-core/blob/master/images/base/Dockerfile) image for Binder.

In this example the Dockerfile is largely a placeholder.
